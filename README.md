# McPit DCS-BIOS

This is in onedrive, and usually edited and compiled directly on McPit. (Laptop works now too!)
Also, committed to something GitHub as /McPit-DCS-BIOS

To program, update the device ID, set the serial port in arduino software, build and then press the button on the target device.

Note: There are build warnings about something like PRR being defined twice.  Doesn't seem to matter.
